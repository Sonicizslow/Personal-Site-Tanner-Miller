            <p>The main reason I went through making a basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript website was to have a simple project completed that was visible. While most companies and large scale projects don’t use HTML and CSS on their own that often anymore, I wanted to start with the basics and go from there.</p>
            <img src="img/what-I-Do-BG.jpeg" alt="">
            <p>Next main steps for the site is getting the first blog post up and making the blog more discoverable on the main page. Once I have the first post up, I would like the revisit accessibility on the pages and general performance improvements. Once everything is cleaned up, I want to recreate the site in React due to its popularity. It would be good practice and I can see how being able to call components from other pages and maintaining them separately is much easier than each static page on its own. I would then also like to place the blogs into a database so I can make this into a full stack application. </p>
            <p>After I get this site rebuilt with React, there is another interesting redo of the site I want to try. John Sundell has a repository on GitHub called <a href=“https://github.com/JohnSundell/Publish” target="_blank">Publish</a> . Publish generates static sites that are built using Swift! You can check John’s site, <a href=“https://swiftbysundell.com” target="_blank">swiftbysundell.com</a> to see a site that’s built using Swift and Publisher. Being that my other project is a weather app that I’m writing in Swift, I think it would be an interesting exercise and good experience to rebuild the site in swift. Another reason I want to give this a go is due to listening to John’s podcast along with StackTrace were John is one of the Co-Hosts.</p>
